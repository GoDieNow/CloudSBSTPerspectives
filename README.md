# Replication Package for the paper "The Cloudification Perspectives of Search-based Software Testing"

The paper involved two authors: [Diego Martin] and [Sebastiano Panichella] from the Zurich University of Applied Science (ZHAW).
The paper has been accepted for publication in the proceedings of the 2019 IEEE/ACM 12th International Workshop on Search-Based Software Testing (SBST 2019).

## Abstract of the paper:

To promote and sustain the future of our society, the most critical challenge of contemporary software engineering and
cloud computing experts are related to the efficient integration of emerging cloudification and DevOps practices in the development
and testing processes of modern systems. In this context, we argue that SBST can play a critical role in improving testing
practices and automating the verification and validation (V&V) of cloudification properties of Cloud Native Applications (CNA).
Hence, in this paper, we focus on the untouched side of SBST in the cloud field, by discussing (1) the testing challenges in the
cloud research field and (2) summarizing the recent contributions of SBST in supporting development practices of CNA. Finally,
we discuss the emerging research topics characterizing the cloudification perspectives of SBST in the cloud field.
